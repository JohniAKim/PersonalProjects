## Background

This repository holds leetCode problems that I have worked through. 

## Index

The projects here are categorized using the Topics defined by leetCode.  I may change this later using some other logic if it makes sense to do that.

- [Algorithms]()
- [Database]()
- [Shell]()
- [Concurrency]()

Each category has their own sub projects for each question and should be accompanied by some form of documentation.
