## Index

This repository holds projects that I've done as part of my continuing education. Currently they're binned in categories based upon topic or functionality.  The categories will continue to expand as I add new work or rediscover shareable prior educational work.

- [Data Engineering]()
- [Data Science]()
- [Data Wrangling]()
- [leetCode](https://github.com/JohniAKim/PersonalProjects/tree/main/Educational/leetCode)

Each category has their own variety of projects and should be accompanied by some form of documentation.
