## Background

This repository holds samples of documentation/artifacts created as part of designing and implementing solutions that I have done.  They is some overlap between this repository and the Database Architecture and Modeling repoository.

The main difference is that this repo also includes other types of documents created such as:
- Functional and Design Specifications
- Application Overviews
- User Guides
- Test Plans
- Migration Plans
- ...more...
