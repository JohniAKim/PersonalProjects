## Index

This repository holds projects that I've done as part of my continuing education. Currently they're binned in categories based upon methodology. 

- [Entity Relationship (ER)]()
  - [Common Notes Subsystem]()
- [Entity Attribute Value (EAV)]()
- [Data Warehouse]()
- [Data Lake]()
- [Data Vault]()
- [ELT and ETL]()
- [Obect Relational Model (ORM)]()

Each category has their own variety of projects and should be accompanied by some form of documentation.
