## Background

This repository holds projects related to Microsoft Access. MS Access is a greatly underated tool for Rapid Application Development (RAD) and Prototyping.  It is also underused for analysis and reporting.  You often see access applications in SMBs or as departmental applications.  There is actually very little you cannot do with MS Access.

The projects here are some of the insights and methods I have utilized to implement solutions for common scenarios, or to expose functionality that is quite often overlooked.  

## Index

- [Common Object Framework]()
  - [Application Versioning]()
  - [Connection Manager]()
  - [Dynamic Configuration]()
  - [...more to come...]()
- [Windows API]()

Each category has their own variety of projects and should be accompanied by some form of documentation.
